Hello ðŸ‘‹, I am Yutao Mou (ç‰Ÿå®‡æ»”). I'm the first year PhD student at the <a href="https://se.pku.edu.cn/kcl/">Knowledge Computing Laboratories</a>, National Engineering Research Center for Software Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, China. I am under the supervision of Prof. Wei Ye and Shikun Zhang. Currently, I focus on large language models (LLMs) post-training and evaluation. My main research interests include LLM Safety and LLM for Software Engineering (SE). I have been working on building safe, reliable and scalable artificial intelligence systems. I have published 20+ papers at the top international AI Conferences.
If you are interested in collaboration, feel free to email me at yutao.mou@stu.pku.edu.cn
